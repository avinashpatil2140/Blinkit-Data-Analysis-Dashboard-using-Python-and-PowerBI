Here are some options for a GitHub repository title and description based on the files you provided.  Blinkit Data Analysis &amp; Dashboard This repository contains a data analysis project focused on Blinkit. It includes a Jupyter notebook for the data analysis process and a Power BI file for the interactive dashboard.

BUSINESS REQUIREMENT

To conduct a comprehensive analysis of Blinkit's sales performance, customer satisfaction, and inventory distribution to identify key insights and opportunities for optimization using various KPIs and visualizations in Power BI.

KPIâ€™s Requirements

Total Sales: The overall revenue generated from all items sold.
Average Sales: The average revenue per sale.
Number of Items: The total count of different items sold.
Average Rating: The average customer rating for items sold. 

Charts requirements

1. Total Sales by Fat Content:
	Objective: Analyze the impact of fat content on total sales.
	Additional KPI Metrics: Assess how other KPIs (Average Sales, Number of Items, Average Rating) vary with fat content.
	Chart Type: Donut Chart.
2. Total Sales by Item Type:
	Objective: Identify the performance of different item types in terms of total sales.
	Additional KPI Metrics: Assess how other KPIs (Average Sales, Number of Items, Average Rating) vary with fat content.
	Chart Type: Bar Chart.
3. Fat Content by Outlet for Total Sales:
	Objective: Compare total sales across different outlets segmented by fat content.
	Additional KPI Metrics: Assess how other KPIs (Average Sales, Number of Items, Average Rating) vary with fat content.
	Chart Type: Stacked Column Chart.
4. Total Sales by Outlet Establishment:
	Objective: Evaluate how the age or type of outlet establishment influences total sales.
	Chart Type: Line Chart.
5. Sales by Outlet Size:
	Objective: Analyze the correlation between outlet size and total sales.
	Chart Type: Donut/ Pie Chart.
6. Sales by Outlet Location:
	Objective: Assess the geographic distribution of sales across different locations.
	Chart Type: Funnel Map.


Key Insights
While the complete analysis was not available, here are some insights that could be derived from the provided dataset based on the columns (Item Type, Sales, Outlet Type, Rating, etc.):

Top-Performing Products: An analysis of the Sales column would likely reveal which Item Type or specific Item Identifier contributes most to overall revenue.

Outlet Performance: By analyzing Sales across different Outlet Identifier and Outlet Type locations, one could identify which stores or types of stores are most profitable.

Location-Based Trends: Examining Outlet Location Type (e.g., Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3) could show if sales or product popularity vary significantly by urban, suburban, or rural areas.

Customer Satisfaction: The Rating column could be analyzed to find any correlation between item type, fat content, or outlet type and customer ratings, which could inform inventory decisions.

Project Conclusion

This data analysis project successfully explored the Blinkit dataset to uncover key trends and patterns in sales and customer ratings. The initial steps of data cleaning and exploratory analysis laid a solid groundwork, identifying the key variables and their statistical distributions. The visualizations created in the Power BI dashboard offer an interactive way to monitor performance and make data-driven decisions.

This project serves as a comprehensive example of a data-to-dashboard workflow, transforming raw data into actionable business intelligence.
